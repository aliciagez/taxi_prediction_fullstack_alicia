EDA / Cleaning data:
I did some basic eda on the dataset, checking datatypes and such. 

For the cleaning i deciden to do 2 version of the origal dataset. One with removed nan values and one with filled nan values. I decided to remove the colums for weather and traffic conditions since they did not seem that relevant. I made the passenge coun to ints since it doesn't make sense for them to be floats. I did some dummy encdoing for time of day and made them into ints and same for day of week. The i export them to their own csv files.
